## How to fix inequality in the game industry which consists predominantly of white males, and caters to them almost exclusively.
It is important that we establish the complexity and stakes of this problem before trying to dissect,
or 'solve' it. Inequality is a social problem that has existed for as long as humans have gathered in
groups, and it will continue long after anyone reading this is dead, until humans themselves are gone.

That does not, however, mean we don't try to improve our situation. Prolong life and the quality of it.
In particular, the field of game design is of personal interest to me and my career, and so the
inequalities felt there touch my life in many ways. By gaining a deeper understanding of the problem
I hope to be better equipped to be a positive force toward improving it. So, how is this problem _wicked_?

**1. There is no definite formulation of a wicked problem.**  
Inequality is always a difficult topic to nail down. Unequal from whose perspective? We can constantly try to rebalance the scales, but the fact is that the scales readings will be different to anyone who looks.

**2. Wicked problems have no stopping rules.**  
There is no _equal_. When we define a domain, like the game industry, as being unequal, it is because the problem has gotten so bad that we can't help but take notice. The closer we get to equality, the harder it will be to know when to stop.

**3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad.**  
Expanding from the above, the effort required to make what one stakeholder believes to be equitable increases exponentially, as the closer it gets, the harder it is for various stakeholders to agree on where the stopping point is.

**4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.**  
Ask one hundred people what and equal game industry looks like, and you will get one hundred different answers. We will always have to have a concern about equality in this, and every industry.

**5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a “one-shot operation”; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly.**  
Attempts to correct equality issues in the game industry have been met with heavy resistance and vitriol, despite the best intentions. This doesn't even mean the attempts were ill-conceived (that is it's own debate), but there are many that don't see this as a problem, and so there will be heavy resistance with any large scale attempts for change. 

**6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.**  
The problem can be approached from countless directions. Do you begin inside large game studios, and try to improve their hiring practices? Do you pursue the perspectives of the consumers of games, and try to widen their taste in game design?

**7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique.**  
Inequality exists in every tech industry, yet it is entirely unique in games, especially considering how involved the audience of the industry is.

**8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another [wicked] problem.**  
We live in a world where a sexist bigot can become president. The attitudes that we need to combat in the game industry is the result of attitudes held by many people in all walks of life. Even the requirements for tight development cycles works against women more than other industries, when it comes to having children for instance.

**9. The causes of a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem’s resolution.**  
If the problem to tackle is to broaden the type of content game studios produce, and therefor broaden the talent desired by companies, that will lead you to far different approaches than if you want to focus on changing hiring practices and 'proving' their worth.

**10. [With wicked problems,] the planner has no right to be wrong.**  
People get hurt, and have gotten hurt while trying to improve the climate of inequality. Rape threats, death threats, bomb threats, and more simply for speaking up. That doesn't mean the approaches were wrong, but goes to show just how high the stakes are, and why we must not be wrong.
