How do you get people to consider their involvement in a larger social issue? How do you persuade them to reconsider (or consider at all) their position or place in a larger system and potentially change? In the game industry, even convincing designers to examine the choices they make in new projects, instead of “because that’s how we’ve always done it”. Say, allowing players to choose their player gender, or whether or not it is actually narratively consistent for a female character to be barely clothed.
