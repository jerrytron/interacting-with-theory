Intervention of the groupthink in players and industry leaders alike is going to be an immensely difficult task. One form of intervention that is taking place are some of the current advocates such as Anita Sarkeesian and ZoÃ« Quinn, who are appealing both to people not traditionally pandered to as a games audience (and so potentially increasing audience with differing views), and those in the industry (or consuming it) that are open to the perspective that something is indeed rotten in the State of Denmark. There are many parties at play, but the two largest that would benefit from intervention are those involved with creating the games, and the primary consumers. Applying the framework of influences could provide great insight into how intervention can better take place, and how effective current attempts at influencing attitudes are.
