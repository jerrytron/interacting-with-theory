Working with white males has been successful so far, and working with others has been more problematic

(perhaps due to less experience due to not getting opportunities?).The primary consumers of the industry, also being overwhelmingly white and male, have continued to foster the attitude of being victims, and games being their escape. Women were mean to them! Didn’t give them any attention! They were nice guys but got NOTHING in return. Games were an outlet. Now THEY want to change them, take them away! They are too sensitive. They can’t take jokes.
