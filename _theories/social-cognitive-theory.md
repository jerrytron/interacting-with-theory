The industry and players have mutually enforced the application of identities on the player such as ‘Gamers’, ‘Hardcore Gamers’, or even ‘Casual Gamers’. Instead of people who play games of varying type and content, the result (especially for the former two) is a collection of people that have come to feel an entitlement toward the content they consume, to the extent of lashing out against any criticism directed at that content. As a whole, they simultaneously take pride in what they consume (as if they own some part of it, despite being only consumers), yet hold the medium back by resisting creative criticism and deep thought that in other creative mediums shows expansion and growth. Gamergate shows this taken to a new level, not just fighting against criticism of the medium, but supremacy of the white, and even more so male majority of the players and industry.
