A common cry in the industry is that the audience WANTS the unilateral content designed against what is primarily white male fantasy. Of course, if this is how they advertise, and this is what is available to play, and other audiences arenâ€™t providing their voice because the entire industry has provided no reason to be of interest to them, why would anyone ask for anything different? If the industry begins by reaching out to more diverse audiences with news, media, content, and creators, perhaps the audience would expand their expectations.
